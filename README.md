# DNA Nucleotide Count Web App

A simple web applicaiton project to help me understand bioinformatics and data science a little more.

Obviously this is as easy as it gets, but just trying to get a grasp of streamlit which is very useful for simple data web dev.

You need streamlit to run the app.

```shellscript
pip install streamlit
```

To start the app run this command while inside the folder.

```shellscript
streamlit run dna.py
```
